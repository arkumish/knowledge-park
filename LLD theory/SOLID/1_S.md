
## 1) S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

### Explanation
Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change. It should only have one responsibility.

### Example
Now imagine you have a class:

```java
class Employee {
    void managePay() {}
    void handleReports() {}
    interface connectDatabase(type) {
        switch(type) {
            case "p"
        }
    }
}
```

Here, the `Employee` class has three methods, each handling a different responsibility. If one day, someone wants to make changes to `handleReports()`, it could impact the entire `Employee` class, affecting unrelated functionalities like payroll management or database connection. This approach can create problems in the future.

### Fix
Separate out the responsibilities into different classes:

```java
class PayrollManager {
    void managePay() {}
}

class DatabaseConnector {
    void connectDatabase() {}
}

class ReportManager {
    void handleReports() {}
}
```

By doing this, each class has a single responsibility, making the code more maintainable and flexible.
