## 2) O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

### Explanation
The Open/Closed Principle states that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means we should be able to add new functionality without modifying existing code.

### Problem
Imagine we have a class:

```java
class AreaCalculator {
    public int getArea(Shape shape) {
        if (shape instanceof Circle) {
            Circle circle = (Circle) shape;
            return Math.PI * circle.radius * circle.radius;
        }
        if (shape instanceof Rect) {
            Rect rect = (Rect) shape;
            return rect.height * rect.width;
        }
        // If we need to add more shapes, we must modify this class.
    }
}
```

This approach is problematic because every time a new shape is added, we have to modify `AreaCalculator`, leading to high coupling.

### Fix
To fix this, we remove this dependency by introducing an interface:

```java
interface Shape {
    double getArea();
}
```

#### Implementations
```java
class Circle implements Shape {
    double radius;
    Circle(double radius) { this.radius = radius; }
    public double getArea() {
        return Math.PI * this.radius * this.radius;
    }
}
```

```java
class Rect implements Shape {
    double height, width;
    Rect(double height, double width) { this.height = height; this.width = width; }
    public double getArea() {
        return this.height * this.width;
    }
}
```

#### Updated AreaCalculator
```java
class AreaCalculator {
    public double getAreaOfShape(Shape shape) {
        return shape.getArea();
    }
}
```

#### Usage
```java
class UserService {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape circle = new Circle(3);
        Shape rect = new Rect(3, 4);
        
        AreaCalculator arc = new AreaCalculator();
        System.out.println(arc.getAreaOfShape(circle));
        System.out.println(arc.getAreaOfShape(rect));
    }
}
```

Now, we can add new shapes without modifying `AreaCalculator`, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle.
