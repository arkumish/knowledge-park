## 3) I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

### Explanation
The Interface Segregation Principle states that interfaces should be segregated based on their specific job. A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.

### Problem
Consider a large interface that forces unrelated methods on all implementing classes:

```java
interface Worker {
    void work();
    void eat();
}
```

If we implement this interface for different types of workers:

```java
class Robot implements Worker {
    public void work() {
        System.out.println("Robot is working");
    }
    public void eat() {
        // Robots don't eat, but they are forced to implement this
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Robots don't eat");
    }
}
```

This violates the ISP because `Robot` is forced to implement `eat()` even though it doesn't need it.

### Fix
We split the interface into smaller, more focused interfaces:

```java
interface Workable {
    void work();
}

interface Eatable {
    void eat();
}
```

Now, classes can implement only the interfaces they need:

```java
class Human implements Workable, Eatable {
    public void work() {
        System.out.println("Human is working");
    }
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Human is eating");
    }
}
```

```java
class Robot implements Workable {
    public void work() {
        System.out.println("Robot is working");
    }
}
```

Now, `Robot` doesn't have to implement `eat()`, adhering to the Interface Segregation Principle.
